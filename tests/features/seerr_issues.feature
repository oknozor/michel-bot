Feature: Seerr issue management via Matrix

  Scenario: A created Seerr issue posts a message in Matrix
    Given a running Matrix homeserver
    And a running PostgreSQL database
    And a room "#support_hoohoot" exists
    And the bot is started and connected to Matrix
    When Seerr sends an "ISSUE_CREATED" webhook with:
      | issue_id    | 42                        |
      | subject     | Video playback problem    |
      | message     | The video won't load      |
      | reported_by | alice                     |
    Then a message appears in "#support_hoohoot" containing "Video playback problem"
    And the message contains "alice"

  Scenario: Resolving an issue posts in the thread and adds a reaction
    Given a running Matrix homeserver
    And a running PostgreSQL database
    And a room "#support_hoohoot" exists
    And the bot is started and connected to Matrix
    And Seerr sends an "ISSUE_CREATED" webhook with:
      | issue_id    | 43                     |
      | subject     | Missing subtitles      |
      | message     | No French subtitles    |
      | reported_by | bob                    |
    And a message appears in "#support_hoohoot" containing "Missing subtitles"
    When Seerr sends an "ISSUE_RESOLVED" webhook with:
      | issue_id     | 43                           |
      | subject      | Missing subtitles            |
      | comment      | Subtitles added manually     |
      | commented_by | admin                        |
    Then a threaded reply appears on the original message containing "Subtitles added manually"
    And the original message has a "✅" reaction

  Scenario: A comment on an issue is posted in the thread
    Given a running Matrix homeserver
    And a running PostgreSQL database
    And a room "#support_hoohoot" exists
    And the bot is started and connected to Matrix

      | subject      | Movie not available       |
      | comment      | Looking into the problem  |
      | commented_by | admin                     |
    Then a threaded reply appears on the original message containing "Looking into the problem"
    And the threaded reply contains "admin"

  Scenario: Admin resolves issue via Matrix command
    Given a running Matrix homeserver
    And a running PostgreSQL database

    And the bot is started and connected to Matrix
    And Seerr sends an "ISSUE_CREATED" webhook with:
      | issue_id    | 50                     |

      | reported_by | alice                  |
    And a message appears in "#support_hoohoot" containing "Broken subtitles"
    When the admin sends '!issues resolve "Subtitles fixed"' as a thread reply
    Then Seerr received a comment "Subtitles fixed" for issue 50
    And Seerr received a resolve request for issue 50
    And a threaded reply appears on the original message containing "resolved"

  Scenario: Reopening an issue removes the reaction and posts in the thread
